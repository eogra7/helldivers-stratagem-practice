# Helldivers 2: Stratagem Activation Sequence Validator

Welcome to the Stratagem Activation Sequence Validator for Helldivers 2, a helpful tool designed to enhance your gaming experience on PC by providing you with a means to validate the correctness of your Stratagem activation sequences.

This tool provides an engaging and interactive way to practice the sequences of keys (i.e., WASD) you need to press while holding down CTRL in order to activate different Stratagems in the game.

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**
   Start by obtaining a copy of the tool; you can do this by either cloning the git repository or downloading it directly.

2. **Open the HTML file:**
   After downloading or cloning the repository to your local machine, all you need to do is open the HTML file contained within.

3. **Activate a Stratagem:**
   Upon successful launch of the tool, you will be prompted to activate a randomly selected Stratagem. You will do this in a similar manner as you would during game play,
   that is, by pressing a sequence of keys (W, A, S, D) while holding down the CTRL key.

4. **Obtain Feedback:**
   The tool will then provide immediate feedback as to whether you have entered the sequence correctly or not.

5. **Pick a New Stratagem:**
   If you want to try another Stratagem, simply press "CTRL + R" to receive a new one.
